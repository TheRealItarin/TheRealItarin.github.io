        <h2>First day: Introduction and beginning of the work</h2>
        <img src="arriving.png" alt="Arriving to Paris">
        <div class="content-preview collapsed" id="content-1">
            <div class="content-full">
                <p>On the first day we received a briefing about the BIP. They explained what they are expecting us to do. In
                    short version:
                    there will be villages which will represent different aspects of cybersecurity. We will be divided into
                    groups and each group will have to visit all villages and complete tasks in them.
                    After this we immediately started the work. (going to villages and complete the tasks)
                    On this day we visited the <b>OSINT/Social Engineering</b> and the <b>Mobile phone security</b> villages.
                    Where we learnt about
                    how to identify and create Phising emails, and how to search and find malicious code inside a mobil app.
                    Between the the village we had
                    a delicious lunch in form of sandwiches. At the end of the day, randomly have been selected a group to
                    summarize the day. An another
                    small note, our team was a little few in numbers, because some of our team members did not show up. So we
                    had to team up with an another
                    group which had the exact same problem. </p>

        <h2>Second day: Digital Forensics and Network security</h2>
        <img src="traffic.png" alt="Network traffic analysis">
        <div class="content-preview collapsed" id="content-2">
            <div class="content-full">
                <p>On the second day we worked with different forensics tools for both the first and second village. With
                    Autopsy, Registry viewer, FTK
                    Imager and similar tools we learned how to extract artifacts from a computer and how to analyze them. Now
                    for the differences between the
                    two village. On the Digital forensics village the hands on tasks were focused on analyzing a computer image
                    as HDD, Registry hives,
                    and RAMs. On the Network village we first learned about the importance of segmentation and other useful
                    network security concepts. For the
                    hands on part we mostly analyzed network traffic using Wireshark. Again, between the villages we had a
                    delicious lunch, this time in form of fresh mixed bowls.
                    At the end of the day, randomly have been selected a group to summarize the day.</p>

        <h2>Third day: Governance and lockpicking</h2>
        <img src="sittingInRoom.jpeg" alt="Presentation about Governance">
        <div class="content-preview collapsed" id="content-3">
            <div class="content-full">
                <p>This day started a little different then the rest, because we had to go to a different location. From now on
                    we were working inside
                    the new bulding of the BIP. The first village was about Governance, where we learned about the importance of
                    policies and procedures in cybersecurity.
                    We also learned about the different roles and responsibilities within an organization. The second village
                    was about lockpicking, where we learned about physical security and how to bypass locks. We had the
                    opportunity to practice our lockpicking skills on various types of locks.
                    Between the villages we had a delicious lunch, this time in form of sandwiches again. At the end of the day,
                    randomly have been selected a group to summarize the day. And as luck would have it, it was our group that
                    had to present the summary.
                    We presented our summary in front of the whole group, which was a great experience for us.

        <h2>Fourth day: Group work and preparing for presentation</h2>
        <img src="present.png" alt="Preparing for presentation">
        <div class="content-preview collapsed" id="content-4">
            <div class="content-full">
                <p>In this last two days of our stay we were asked to finish a special assignment which were a complicated task
                    which included every
                    type of village we visited. We had to work in groups and prepare a presentation about our findings and
                    experiences during this two last day.
                    We had to analyze the data we collected and present it in a clear manner. This was a great opportunity for
                    us to apply what we learned during the week and to work as a team.
                    But it would not be this easy, because of course I had to take an exam just before the presentation. So I
                    had to study for the exam and prepare for the presentation at the same time.
                    It was a special experience for me, because I had to manage my time and prioritize my tasks. Luckly the
                    sandwiches were delicious and gave me the energy I needed to finish everything on time.

        <h2>Fifth day: Presentation time!</h2>
        <img src="endOf.jpg" alt="End of the week">
        <div class="content-preview collapsed" id="content-5">
            <div class="content-full">
                <p>As the last day begin of this wonderful experience, I headed to a different room then the rest of my group.
                    Me and a friend of my
                    were headed to the exam room. Just moments later, the exam started. It was a difficult exam, but I managed
                    to finish it on time. At
                    least that what I was thinking, but then I realized that my team already started the presentation without
                    me. I rushed to the room where they were presenting and joined them.
                    Needed a moment to gather myself, and catch up with the presentation. But luckily, I managed to do it and we
                    finished the presentation successfully.
                    At the end of the day everyone was gathered in the main room, where the organizers thanked us for our
                    participation and gave us a certificate of completion.
                    Other than that, the organizers announced the winners of the BIP, and suprisingly our group won the second
                    place! We were very happy and proud of ourselves.
